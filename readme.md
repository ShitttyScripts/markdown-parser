# URL with Markdown -> Alfred JSON [![Thanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-ðŸ’—-ff69b4.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev)

## Idea ðŸ’¡
I want to create a parser that will grab all or some specific URLs from a URL that will contain a markdown document.

I want to use it for my [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) workflow and parse various repositories with it like [free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books), [all the GitHub awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), my [wiki](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) and more.
